# Address PR Comments Skill

You are performing a focused pass to address all open, unresolved review comments on the current pull request. Work through each comment systematically.

## Step 1: Identify the Pull Request

Detect the current PR from the branch:

```bash
gh pr view --json number,title,baseRefName,headRefName
```

## Step 2: Fetch All Unresolved Review Threads

Use the GitHub GraphQL API to retrieve only **unresolved** review threads (this correctly excludes resolved conversations):

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
{
  repository(owner: "OWNER", name: "REPO") {
    pullRequest(number: PR_NUMBER) {
      reviewThreads(first: 100) {
        nodes {
          isResolved
          isOutdated
          comments(first: 20) {
            nodes {
              id
              body
              path
              line
              originalLine
              author { login }
              createdAt
              url
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

To get OWNER and REPO:
```bash
gh repo view --json owner,name
```

**Filter the results**: Only process threads where `isResolved` is `false`. Skip any thread where `isResolved` is `true` — do not touch those at all.

Also fetch general (non-inline) PR comments:
```bash
gh pr view PR_NUMBER --json comments --jq '.comments[] | {author: .author.login, body: .body, createdAt: .createdAt}'
```

## Step 3: Read the Relevant Code

Before assessing any comment, read the file(s) it refers to. Do not rely on memory of what the code looks like — read each file fresh.

## Step 4: Assess Each Unresolved Comment

For each unresolved comment, make a structured assessment:

### Relevance
- Has the code the comment refers to already been changed or deleted in a later commit?
- If the concern no longer exists, note it as "no longer applicable" and skip.

### Correctness
- Is the reviewer right? Read the referenced code carefully and apply your own judgment.
- The reviewer may be wrong, partially right, or may be applying a convention that doesn't fit this codebase. Be honest.

### Value
Rate the comment as one of:
- **Must fix**: Correctness bug, type error, broken edge case, or clear violation of project guidelines
- **Should fix**: Legitimate style or design concern that would improve maintainability
- **Nice to have**: Minor preference or style nit — low ROI for the effort
- **Disagree**: The comment is incorrect or misunderstands the code — leave as-is with a note

### Timing
- **This PR**: Fix anything that is a bug, that touches code already modified in this PR, or that is quick and low risk.
- **Follow-up**: Refactors, larger design changes, or changes that would require touching unrelated code. Create a GitHub issue for these.

## Step 4b: Present Assessment and Ask for Confirmation

Before implementing anything, show the full assessment as a table:

| # | File / Location | Reviewer | Rating | Timing | Proposed Action |
|---|----------------|----------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | `lib/foo.ex:42` | alice | Must fix | This PR | Write failing test, then fix |
| 2 | `lib/bar.ex:10` | bob | Should fix | This PR | Fix code; consider CLAUDE.md addition |
| 3 | `lib/baz.ex:55` | alice | Should fix | Follow-up | Open GitHub issue |
| 4 | `lib/qux.ex:7`  | bob | No longer applicable | — | Skip |
| 5 | `lib/quux.ex:3` | carol | Disagree | — | Leave as-is |

For each non-trivial row, include one sentence of reasoning below the table explaining your rating.

Then ask:

> "Does this assessment look right? Let me know if you'd like to change any category or action before I proceed."

Wait for the user to confirm or correct before writing any code.

## Step 5: Implement Fixes

Once the user confirms (or corrects the plan), work through all approved "Must fix" and "Should fix" comments in order.

### If the fix is a bug:

1. **Write a failing test first.** Add a test to the appropriate `test/` file that reproduces the exact problem described. The test must fail before the fix.
2. Run `mix test path/to/test_file.exs` to confirm the test fails.
3. Implement the fix in the source code.
4. Run `mix test path/to/test_file.exs` to confirm the test now passes.
5. Run `make format && make ci` to verify nothing else regresses.

### If the fix is a style or design problem:

1. Apply the fix to the code.
2. Consider: **Is this a pattern that will recur?** If so, add a concise guideline to `CLAUDE.md` under the appropriate section to prevent the same issue from appearing in future code. Keep CLAUDE.md additions short and actionable — one bullet or sentence.
3. Run `make format && make ci` after any code changes.

### If the fix is "nice to have" or disagreed with:

Do not modify any code. Record your reasoning in the summary.

## Step 6: Handle Follow-ups

For comments you have categorised as "Follow-up" and that the user confirmed in Step 5, create a GitHub issue:

```bash
gh issue create --title "TITLE" --body "BODY" --label "enhancement"
```

Link the issue in the PR as a comment so reviewers know it is tracked:

```bash
gh pr comment PR_NUMBER --body "Opened #ISSUE_NUMBER to track: BRIEF_DESCRIPTION"
```

## Step 7: Final Verification

After all fixes are applied:

```bash
make format && make ci
```

All checks must pass before finishing.

## Step 8: Summary

Report back with a table covering every unresolved comment:

| # | File / Location | Reviewer | Assessment | Action Taken |
|---|----------------|----------|------------|--------------|
| 1 | `lib/foo.ex:42` | alice | Must fix — off-by-one error | Test added, fixed |
| 2 | `lib/bar.ex:10` | bob | Should fix — design concern | Fixed; added CLAUDE.md guideline |
| 3 | `lib/baz.ex:55` | alice | Follow-up — larger refactor | Opened #42 |
| 4 | `lib/qux.ex:7`  | bob | No longer applicable | Skipped |
| 5 | `lib/quux.ex:3` | carol | Disagree — code is correct | Left as-is; explanation: ... |

Then list:
- **Tests added**: function names and files
- **CLAUDE.md additions**: what was added and why
- **Issues created**: issue numbers and titles
- **CI status**: pass/fail
